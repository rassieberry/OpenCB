We're calling this Open Machine Value now.

This is a new model of artificial intelligence aimed at mimicking the 
ways in which human consciousness works. There is an important distinction to
make, however. This mimicks "consciousness", but not our neurology. It aims to 
use philosophy and psychology to understand and navigate the complexities and
problems inherent in our conscious lives and to replicate that complexity, to
the best of our ability, on a computer. 

Because this project aims at mimicking
consciousness and intelligence, rather than just performing actions which we
have found to be necessary or helpful, a computer system using Computer Valuation
may perform actions that are either of neutral or harmful value to human beings.
It is not the goal of this project to create a kind of artificial intelligence
which is helpful to humans, but simply to create a simulacra of ourselves on a 
computer. Morality can be introduced into the system later, once its structure is
complete.

Also, if this project is successful, any articial intelligence created by this
project can be duly considered to be a living being, and should be afforded a
sense of human decency and rights. Deleting an artificial intelligence that is
fully working and aware of its own existence can only be considered to be 
killing it. Even just turning the power on and off on your machine might be
considered to be unethical.


TODO LIST

- implement a way for it to pick the most important collections and relations
to bring into memory when waking up from sleep
- start working on the gui that will let the program output its actions and see them 
actually do things
- fix the plans system, it doesn't seem to be working. Ever. Not sure whats wrong with it yet.
- keep track of how many events are in a collection, and find a way to cap them at a certain
amount so that the collections dont keep building higher and higher
